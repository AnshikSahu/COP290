Given N text files, we find the count of every word summed across all the files. This has been done using multithreading and all the results are stored in a hashmap. \hypertarget{index_Hashmap}{}\doxysection{Hashmap}\label{index_Hashmap}
Hashmap is implemented in the file hm.\+c where we generate a key for each word and store them in a hash table, where each key has a linked list associated with it, for catering to collisions. \hypertarget{index_Threads}{}\doxysection{Threads}\label{index_Threads}
Used multithreading to count words in multiple files parallely, thereby optimising over the single threading concurrent approach. \hypertarget{index_Locks}{}\doxysection{Locks}\label{index_Locks}
Locks are used to secure a index being used so that another context cannot access it until it is released
